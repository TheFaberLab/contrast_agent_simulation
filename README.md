# IONP Simulations
Still in developement phase!

#What is needed to run the Simulations

1) C++ compiler (C++17 or newer)
2) cmake (min 3.16.)

#How to compile the Simulations

1) create build folder in the simulation folder
2) open terminal in build folder and run:
      cmake ../
3) then run:
      make
4) after that the C++ program is compiled and the executable file is in "/simulation/build/src/ionp/" and is called "IONP"

#How to set parameters for a Simulation

Write the parameters in .txt/.dat file and put the file in the "simulation/ini" folder
Important: All .txt or .dat files in this folder are read for simulations - it is possible to put multiple files in this folder to run multiple simulations one after the other!!!

Possible parameters are: Everything in SI-Units (except concentration)!

Not all parameters have to be defined! For Example:
- General: Not specifically defined parameters are 0
- No IONP number: The IONP_pos file for manual placement of IONP is used
- No aggregate number but a aggregate radius: Agg_pos file used for manual Aggregate placement
- No aggregate radius but a aggregate number: Aggregates are placed as dense Aggregates
- No nodes: B-Field will be calculated at every diffusion step of every proton (time consuming)
- No time steps: Variable time steps are used - smaller if protons are close to IONP

Under "/include/mptmacros.h" parameters are defined that are usually not changes that often (as global variables):
- Gyromagnetic ratio
- Diffusion constant
- IONP magnetization (used if no magnetic moment is given)

Examples for ini files of usual simulations in /ini!


In "simulation/ini/IONP_pos" it is possible to define the position of the IONPs manually:

- Put a .txt file in this folder with the positions of the IONP like
  x1 y1 z1
  x2 y2 z2
  ...

The same concept for "simulation/ini/Agg_pos", where you can define position of Aggregates manually

In "simulation/ini/DLS_File" it is possible to include a Histogramm file that contains a distribution of IONP radii

- Put a .txt file in this folder with columns radius, intensity like 
      r1 i1
      r2 i2
      ...


Output is in "simulation/data" folder with a log in "simulation/data/log"
and the actual files in "simulation/data/tmp"

#How to run Simulation

1) run the executable IONP file in folder "/simulation/build/src/ionp/" (depending on operating system what kind of file)
